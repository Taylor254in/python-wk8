# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a data analysis and visualization dashboard focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in East African countries â€” specifically **Kenya**, **Uganda**, and **Tanzania**. Using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), it highlights the trends in total cases, deaths, and data reporting gaps across the region.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze and clean COVID-19 data for selected East African countries.
- Visualize trends in infections and deaths over time.
- Handle missing or incomplete datasets through interpolation.
- Demonstrate effective use of Python libraries for data science and visualization.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
- **pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For clean static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive charts and comparative views.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-global-data-tracker.git
   cd covid19-global-data-tracker

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Kenya had the most consistent data reporting among the three countries.

Uganda and Tanzania had large gaps in data, requiring interpolation.

A visible spike in cases was observed during mid-2021 across all countries.

Data cleaning and visual exploration revealed regional disparities in pandemic reporting.

ðŸ¤” Reflections

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Handling real-world messy data.

Visualizing time-series health data effectively.

Using Python libraries in tandem for analysis and storytelling.

It also emphasized the importance of data transparency and consistency during global health crises.
